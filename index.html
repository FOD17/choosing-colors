    <h1>Choosing Colors for Your Websites</h1>
    <p>Choose and tweak color palettes. And fix when you choose colors and nothing seems to work together.</p>

    <h2>Color</h2>
    <p>The general term used to describe hue, tint, tone, shade, and temperature.</p>

    <h2>Hue</h2>
    <p>Refers to the dominant Color Family of the specific color we're looking at.</p>
    <p>White, Black, and Grey are never referred to as a Hue</p>

    <h2>Tint</h2>
    <p>Hue or mixture of pure colors with only White added (or moving closer to white)</p>
    <p>Doesn't make it brighter, but lightens the color</p>

    <h2>Tone</h2>
    <p>Hue or mixture of pure colors with only Gray added (or moving closer to gray)</p>
    <p>This tones down the intensity of a color</p>

    <h2>Shade</h2>
    <p>Hue or mixture of pure colors with only Black added (or moving closer to black)</p>
    <p>No white or gray</p>

    <h2>Temperature</h2>
    <p>Our perception of color as being either warm or cool</p>
    <p>Warm: Add red or yellow to a hue</p>
    <p>Cool: Add blue or green to a hue</p>

    <h2>Color Models</h2>
    <h3>CMYK: Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black.</h3>
    <p> This uses "subtractive" mixing of light to derive different colors.</p>
    <p>Subtractive means to cover up the whiteness on the page</p>
    <br>

    <h3>RGB: Red, Blue, Green. </h3>
    <p>This uses "additive" mixing of light to derive different colors.</p>
    <p>Like having 3 bright red, green, and blue lights projecting at you.</p>
    <br>

    <h3>HSB (V): Hue, Saturation, and Brightness. </h3>
    <p>This uses a mixture of these attributes to derive different colors.</p>
    <p>Changes the purity and density of color as well as how much light is projected through the color.</p>
    <p>Very common.</p>
    <p>How he see color and how our brains work.</p>

    <h1>Color Categories and Families</h1>
    <h3>Trick: Stick with one category or pair one category with neutrals. You only need to find 1 color to make it all match!</h3>
